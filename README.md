NIRA - NeuroMat Individual Report of Activities
====
<strong>About NIRA</strong><br>
Main goals of the NeuroMat Individual Report of Activities (NIRA) are twofold. Firstly, it will automatically feed NeuroMat's annual Report of Activities, a document that is submitted annually to the SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). Secondly, it will serve as a direct liaison of each investigator and NeuroMat's administrative body, especially in the identifying and processing of needs for the course of NeuroMat-related activities.
